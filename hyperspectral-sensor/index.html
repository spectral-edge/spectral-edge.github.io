        <h2>The hyperspectral cube</h2>
        <p> 
            Hyperspectral sensors capture multiple narrow band images over a 
            spectral range. While common RGB images have just three chromatic 
            components, hyperspectral images feature many spectral bands, with 
            a spectral dimension added to the two spatial dimensions characteristic 
            of images. As a result, they’re usually referred to as hyperspectral 
            cubes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As they contain information at different specific wavelengths, 
            hyperspectral cubes enable the analysis and identification of objects 
            based on their spectroscopic properties.

        <h2>Types of hyperspectral sensors</h2>
        <p>
            There are three main methods of acquiring a hyperspectral cube: spatial 
            scanning, spectral scanning, and snapshot imaging. They’re based on 
            different sensor arrangements and acquisition principles. Each option 
            results in a different tradeoff between spatial resolution, spectral 
            resolution, and acquisition time.

        <h2>Snapshot hyperspectral sensors</h2>
        <p>

            The last trend in the field, snapshot sensors collect the entire 3D 
            datacube in a single shot without scanning. As a result, they don’t 
            need any mechanical part and are free of scanning artifacts. They’re far 
            more robust, compact, and cost effective than any other HSI sensing 
            approach and have higher optical efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best example of snapshot sensors are IMEC’s patented mosaic 
            sensors that feature a mosaic of filters deposited or placed on top 
            of standard sensors. Mosaics can be designed on purpose in different 
            arrangements like 4x4 pixels (16 filters) or 5x5 pixels (25 filters). 
            While they tradeoff spatial and spectral resolution, they’re the only 
            option for real time snapshot hyperspectral imaging, a killing advantage 
            for so many applications.

            We may find them in a great camera brand like Photonfocus for visible 
            and NIR range. 
            SpectralEdge provides a seamless connection and acquisition process with
            these amazing HSI sensors, allowing to take the most of their impressive 
            300 fps capability in e.g. a high speed product inspection and sorting    
            use case.

        <h2>Spatial Scanning sensors</h2>
        <p>
            Spatial scanning is one of the traditional methods used for acquiring 
            hyperspectral cubes. In this approach, many spectral bands are acquired 
            for a single spatial line at a time by using a dispersive element like a 
            prism or grating. The remaining spatial dimension is scanned through 
            different approaches, such as using a moving mirror, a rotating prism or 
            through camera or object movement. As a result, they are more prone to 
            motion artifacts if there are movements or vibrations during the scanning 
            process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spatial scanning cameras have been widely used for years and are known 
            for their high spectral and spatial resolution. The scanning process can 
            be time-consuming, especially for high-resolution images, which usually 
            prevents real-time applications. The use of a dispersive element and 
            even mechanical components make them bulky and expensive. However, they’re 
            still the sensor of choice when spectral and spatial resolution are a must.

          <h2>Spectral scanning sensors</h2>
          <p>
            Rather than scanning the spatial dimensions, spectral scanning sensors acquire 
            the entire scene simultaneously. They usually achieve this by using a tunable 
            filter to selectively transmit different spectral bands onto a 2D detector 
            array in relatively short times. While they are often much faster than a spatial 
            scanning sensor they’re not truly snapshot and may still suffer from motion 
            artifacts. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, spectral scanning sensors trade-off their spatial and spectral 
            resolution, as the performance of the tunable filters can affect these parameters.

          <h2>Acquiring and handling the hyperspectral cube</h2>
          <p>
            When starting to work with hyperspectral sensors one major hurdle is the 
            extraction of useful information from the sensor. First of all, we need to 
            acquire the images. Next, we need to reconstruct the hyperspectral cube and 
            finally we need to analyse it. Each of these steps require specialised 
            software routines, that are usually hard to craft. Moreover, HSI images may 
            be too heavy to handle in a consumer PC.
