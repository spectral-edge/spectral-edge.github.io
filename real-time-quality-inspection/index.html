          Combine state-of-the-art imaging and machine learning technology to
          accurately detect any kind of defect in wooden boards, ensuring a
          high-quality final product for your furniture.

          Assure the inspection of every part with the most efficient and
          reliable defect detection in the production line. Take corrective
          measures upon any defect in real time.

        <h2>Precise Color Measurement with HyperSpectral Imaging</h2>
        <p>
          Custom calibrations and out-of-the-box support of snapshot HSI
          cameras, allowing for a precise and reliable measurement of color in
          Lab coordinates. Unlike point colorimeters that measure the color on a
          spot, SpectralEdge allows the inspection of the whole board surface,
          detecting any local deviation from the specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assure the absolute color of furniture parts, avoiding color drifts
          between batches that are hard to detect in production but become
          evident downstream, when parts from different batches are assembled.

          Quality inspection that adapts to production changes driven by market

        <p>
          Adapt quickly to production changes. Easily retrain inspection models
          to include references with new characteristics (e.g. new finishing or
          textures) and even new types of board defects.

          SpectralEdge comes with a cloud-based API and easy to customize
          examples to build, store, and update datasets in the cloud and to
          train, validate, and deploy machine learning models back to the edge.

        <h2>
          How to achieve 100% Furniture Quality Control with HyperSpectral
          Imaging
        </h2>
        <p>
          SpectralEdge enabled the implementation and deployment of a
          comprehensible and cost-effective solution to the monitoring needs of
          a leading manufacturer of wooden furniture for bathrooms. They have to
          inspect the whole production as furniture parts flow out of the
          production line. Defect detection at speed is a challenging and
          demanding task requiring several operators working in parallel. Given
          the production conditions, color measurement is performed offline on a
          reduced sample of parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monitoring the production with a snapshot HSI camera combined with
          SpectralEdge has proven a solution to assure a complete inspection of
          every part in real time. Any defect or color deviation can now be
          detected and the corresponding part diverted for deciding about
          reworking or recycling the part.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small dataset of images of wooden boards acquired with a selection
          of samples was enough to assess the feasibility of the inspection
          approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          SpectralEdge accelerates and lowers the cost of development of
          solutions that assure quality inspection of furniture parts in real
          time in the production line.
