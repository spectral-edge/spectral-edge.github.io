        <h2>HSI for Food Analysis and Control with SpectralEdge</h2>
        <p>
            HyperSpectral Imaging (HSI) technology enables a real-time and in-depth analysis of food products and the online detection of quality issues and contaminants.
        </p>
        <p>
            With SpectralEdge, you can easily take advantage of HSI technology to improve quality and process control, optimize production processes, and increase efficiency.
        </p>

        <h2>Quick Data Acquisition and Dataset Creation</h2>
        <p>
            SpectralEdge allows for quick and easy data acquisition from HSI cameras, enabling you to create labeled datasets of food samples for model training in a matter of minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system's user-friendly interface and the integration with the cloud makes it much easier to acquire and process all the data that you need to create specific classification models.
        </p>

        <h2>No-Code Food Monitoring Feasibility Studies</h2>
        <p>
            SpectralEdge's no-code approach to feasibility studies allows you to quickly and easily test the potential of HSI in your food production process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Out-of-the-box ready-to-train HSI models enable feasibility studies with minimal training and setup time, allowing you to make informed decisions about the adoption of HSI technology in food production processes.
        </p>

        <h2>How to assure quality control of food industry compliant</h2>
        <p>
            SpectralEdge was the answer for a leading chocolate manufacturer that has been dealing for long with the challenge of automating the control of the gloss process, keeping a consistent and optimal chocolate gloss. Until now, the procedure to control the process was purely manual and highly reliant on the expertise of the operator. Inevitably, sometimes resulted in excessive or insufficient use of gloss agents resulting in waste and production delays.
        </p>
        <p>
            Analyzing the gloss of the chocolate with SpectralEdge, they were able to precisely control the amount of gloss agent added as well as the time spent in the process to achieve the intended result.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to assess the feasibility of process automation, a small dataset obtained from just 42 chocolate samples was enough to determine the feasibility of automating the quality control of the gloss process.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using SpectralEdge, you may also be able to improve the quality of products, reduce waste, and increase food production efficiency, all while keeping costs in check.
