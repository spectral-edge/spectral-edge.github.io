        <h2>What is a hyperspectra camera</h2>
        <p> 
          Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) cameras break down the spectrum into numerous 
          narrow bands, enabling the detailed analysis of materials based on their 
          spectral signatures. This technology provides a comprehensive understanding 
          of the composition and characteristics of the imaged objects or surfaces.

        <h2>Camera Size, Weight, and cost</h2>
        <p>
          Size and weight are largely dependent on the optical arrangement used to 
          separate the spectral bands. While some HSI cameras tend to be much bigger 
          and heavier than standard RGB cameras, due to bulkier optical systems with 
          prisms and gratings, and even mechanical scanners; there are also systems 
          with sensor-integrated filters that are as compact and light as their RGB 
          counterparts.   Like in traditional cameras, the cost of a HSI camera depends 
          on two main factors: the optics and the sensor. Bulky optics around a prism 
          or grating are more expensive than sensor-integrated filters. As well, sensors 
          in the SWIR range like InGaAs are much more expensive than CMOS sensors in 
          the visible-NIR spectrum.

        <h2>Acquisition Speed: Snapshot or Scanning</h2>
        <p>
            Hyperspectral data acquisition can occur through two primary methods: 
            snapshot (e.g. PhotonFocus spectral cameras) or scanning (e.g. Specim 
            spectral cameras). Snapshot acquisition is characteristic of sensor-integrated 
            cameras and captures the entire hyperspectral cube in one instant, suitable 
            for dynamic scenes. Scanning is characteristic of HSI cameras with optics based 
            on a prism or grating and involves sequentially capturing spectral bands, 
            offering better spectral performance.

        <h2>Spectral and Spatial Resolution</h2>
        <p>
            While sensor-integrated filter cameras feature reduced cost, weight and size 
            as well as snapshot and realtime acquisition capabilities that improve 
            usability, they also involve a loss in terms of spectral resolution, spatial 
            resolution, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scanning HSI cameras may be bulkier and slower, 
            but they bring exceptional spectral and spatial resolution, allowing for the 
            capture of detailed information in both the spectral and spatial domains. High 
            spectral resolution enables the differentiation of subtle variations in material 
            composition, while spatial resolution adds to the clarity of images. This 
            capability makes HSI scanning cameras a requirement for some tasks requiring a 
            high precision in analysis and identification.

          <h2>Image Acquisition and Processing</h2>
          <p>
            HSI cameras generate datacubes, three-dimensional arrays where each pixel 
            contains spectral information, allowing users to extract meaningful insights 
            and make informed decisions in fields ranging from agriculture and environmental 
            monitoring to healthcare and beyond. However efficient datacube acquisition and 
            processing can be challenging. To start with, the need of datacube 
            reconstruction and sometimes calibration makes putting a HSI camera to work much 
            harder compared to a standard RGB camera. And this is generally true for any 
            type of HSI camera. 
          </p>
          <p>
            But difficulties donâ€™t stop here. As our eyes can only see trichromatic 
            representations, visualization and analysis of HSI data is not straightforward. 
            Tailored processing and ML approaches are needed that cater to the additional 
            dimensionality of the data. As if that weren't enough, datacubes are usually 
            much heavier than RGB images.
          </p>
